Regularization is the technique widely used to solve the ill-conditioned inverse problem. However, a optimized value of regularization parameter is important for inverse process. 
Here we develop the L-curve based method to derive the optimzed Tikhonove regularization parameter and spatially variant regularization parameter.
The script restively optimize the Tikhonove regularization and spatially variant parameter
